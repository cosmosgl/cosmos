# cosmos.gl Charter

## **Section 0: Guiding Principles**

**Mission:** Provide the web development community with a high-performance framework for visualizing network graphs and scatter plots.

**Vision:** Deliver fast, robust, open-source data visualization tools that empower interactive, scalable analysis in the browser.

**Values:**

- **Performance First:** Prioritize speed and efficiency in every feature and implementation.  
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the API is intuitive and the tooling easy to adopt, lowering barriers for developers.  
- **Community:** Foster open collaboration, welcoming contributions and feedback.  
- **Transparency:** Maintain clear documentation, benchmarks, and decision-making processes.

## **Section 1: Scope**

cosmos.gl is a browser-native, GPU-accelerated force-directed graph layout and rendering engine designed to visualize and interact with massive, complex datasets at scale. By leveraging WebGL, it delivers fast simulations and real-time rendering of millions of nodes and edges directly in the browser. cosmos.gl bridges the gap between high-performance data visualization and interactive web-based research workflows, serving developers, researchers, and analysts. Its value lies in unlocking scalable, explainable graph exploration for AI, biotech, finance, and data science stakeholders.

### **1.1: In-scope**

- GPU-accelerated graph algorithms  
- WebGL-based rendering of large-scale graph structures  
- Browser-native integration with frontend tooling and workflows

### **1.2: Out-of-Scope**

- Full-fledged graph analytics  
- Backend data processing and pipelines

## **Section 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC**

Technical leadership of the cosmos.gl project is delegated to the cosmos.gl Technical Steering Committee (TSC) by the OpenJS Cross Project Council (CPC). The TSC is also responsible for deciding how to allocate earmarked funds it might receive through the Foundation. Amendments to this charter require approval from both the CPC, through its [decision-making process](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CPC-CHARTER.md#section-9-decision-making), and the TSC.

### **2.1 Other Formal Project Relationships**

## **Section 3: cosmos.gl TSC Governing Body**

TSC members can be either regular members or voting members. Regular members can attend meetings and participate in TSC discussions, but do not vote. Voting members can do everything regular members can do, and also have the ability to cast votes when consensus is not reached on an issue.

TSC memberships are not time-limited. There is no maximum size of the TSC. 

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TSC membership beyond these rules. The TSC may add additional voting members to the TSC by a standard TSC motion. A TSC member can be removed from the TSC by voluntary resignation or by a standard TSC motion. A standard TSC motion can be used to change a regular TSC member to a voting TSC member, or to change a voting TSC member to a regular TSC member.

The TSC shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the community. The meeting shall be directed by the TSC Chairperson. Responsibility for directing individual meetings may be delegated by the TSC Chairperson to any other TSC voting member. Minutes or an appropriate recording shall be taken and made available to the community through accessible public postings.

TSC voting members are expected to regularly participate in TSC activities.

A TSC voting member is automatically converted to a TSC regular member if they do not participate in three consecutive TSC votes.

## **Section 4: Roles & Responsibilities**

Subject to such policies as may be set by the CPC, the TSC is responsible for all technical development within the [cosmos.gl](http://cosmos.gl)  project, including:

- Setting release dates.  
- Release quality standards.  
- Technical direction.  
- Project governance and process.  
- GitHub repository hosting.  
- Conduct guidelines.  
- Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.  
- Development process and any coding standards.  
- Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators or Foundation projects.

The TSC will define cosmos.gl projectâ€™s release vehicles.

### **Section 4.1 Project Operations & Management**

The TSC will establish and maintain a development process for the cosmos.gl project. The development process will establish guidelines for how the developers and community will operate. It will, for example, establish appropriate timelines for TSC review (e.g. agenda items must be published at least a certain number of hours in advance of a TSC meeting).

The TSC and entire technical community will follow any processes as may be specified by the OpenJS Foundation Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of contributions, including the OpenJS Foundation IP Policy.

### **Section 4.2: Decision-making, Voting, and/or Elections**

For internal project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under Lazy Consensus. The TSC shall establish appropriate guidelines for implementing Lazy Consensus (e.g. expected notification and review time periods) within the development process.

The TSC follows a [Consensus Seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) decision making model among voting members. When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

For all votes, the winning candidate option is the one that wins a simple majority of all TSC voting members in every head-to-head election against each of the other candidates. A TSC voting member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention. As long as a vote is open, TSC voting members' choices must not be disclosed, to avoid influencing other voting members.
